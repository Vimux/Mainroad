## Installation

*Before starting, please be sure that you have
[installed Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo) and
[created a new site](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-2-create-a-new-site). After that, you ready to
install **Mainroad**.*

In your Hugo site `themes` directory, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/vimux/mainroad
```

Or, if you don't plan to make any significant changes, but want to track and update the theme, you can add it as a git
submodule via the following command:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/vimux/mainroad
```

Next, open `config.toml` in the base of the Hugo site and ensure the theme option is set to `mainroad`:

```
theme = "mainroad"
```

For more information read the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) of Hugo.

A good idea is not to copy all these settings without understanding how it works. Use only those parameters that you
need.

For more information about front matter variables read
[Hugo Front Matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter) from Hugo official documentation.

### Logo

**Mainroad** allows you to set a custom logo in the site header. You may use text, or image, or both. Use the following
options in your site config:

```toml
[Params.logo]
  image = "img/placeholder.png"
  title = "Mainroad"
  subtitle = "Just another site"
```

Please be noted that the logo image will display at a maximum width of 128 pixels and a maximum height of 128 pixels
when you use text and image simultaneously. When the only logo image is active, it will display at a maximum height of
256 pixels. Ideally, your image should be SVG.

### Sidebar

**Mainroad** comes with a configurable sidebar that can be on the left, on the right, or disabled. The default layout
can be specified in the `[Params.sidebar]` section of the configuration. The position can be specified for home, list
and single pages individually. Use the keys `home`, `list` and `single` with values `"left"`, `"right"` or `false`. The
layout can be configured per page, by setting the `sidebar` parameter with one of the same values in the page's front
matter.

The sidebar consists of multiple widgets. Widgets can be enabled individually using the `widgets` key with a list of
widget names as value. You can add your own widgets, by placing a template under `layouts/partials/widgets/<name>.html`.
The list of widgets can be overwritten from a page's front matter.

Some widget respect optional configuration. Have a look at the `[Params.widgets]` and `[Params.widgets.social]` sections
in the example configuration above.

### Menus

**Mainroad** supports multiple menus. The `main` menu is fully responsive and displayed right under the site header. The
secondary menus `side` and `footer` are displayed in a sidebar widget and the page footer. To add a page to a menu, add
a `menu: <menu>` parameter to the page's front matter:

```yaml
menu: main # Add page to a main menu
```

You can also add a page to multiple menus by providing a list:

```yaml
menu: ["main", "side", "footer"] # Add page to a main, side, and footer menu
```

**Note:** Don't forget to enable the `sidemenu` widget in the `widgets` configuration param if you want to use the
`side` menu.

**Note:** Please keep in mind that Mainroad menus don't support nested items i.e. submenus.

### Social Widget: custom links

**Mainroad** contains built-in social links in the social widget. In addition, you can also set custom social links by
adding `Params.widgets.social.custom` to your `config.toml`. Here is an example.

```toml
[[Params.widgets.social.custom]]
  title = "Youtube"
  url = "https://youtube.com/user/username"
  icon = "youtube.svg"
```

**Note:** You need to put your icon file in `layouts/partials` directory under your project's root if you want to
display an icon of your social link. The `icon` filed, which is optional, should be a path relative to
`layouts/partials`.

**Note:** *Only* SVG files are supported to be used as custom social icons in the current version. If you use any files
of another format, PNG for example, a compile error will be raised by Hugo.

**Note:** Not every SVG icon can be used. For better results, it should be one-color SVG file with a special class
attribute `{{ with .class }}{{ . }} {{ end }}` and 24x24 size. At a minimum, custom SVG icon needs these attributes:

```html
<svg class="{{ with .class }}{{ . }} {{ end }} icon" width="24" height="24">...</svg>
```
