# Mainroad

**Mainroad** is a responsive, simple, clean and content-focused [Hugo](//gohugo.io/) theme based on the [MH Magazine lite](//wordpress.org/themes/mh-magazine-lite/) WordPress theme by [MH Themes](//www.mhthemes.com/).

**[Alternate Demo (Best)](//hugothemes.gitlab.io/mainroad/)** | [Standart Demo](http://themes.gohugo.io/theme/mainroad/)

**Adaptation has several changes:**

+ Include Hugo internal templates (Open Graph, Disqus, Google Analytics)
+ New responsive menu without jQuery
+ BEM-like class naming
+ SVG icons instead of font icons
+ Theme options are saved (Sidebar position, Author Box, Post Navigation) and available through config.toml file parameters
+ Other small changes

**Browser support:**

+ **Desktop:** IE9+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari
+ **Mobile:** Android browser (on Android 4.4+), Safari (on iOS 7+), Google Chrome, Opera mini

Other browsers (like Opera on Blink engine) are also supported, but not tested. Support for older versions of Internet Explorer (IE8 and below) ended.

## Installation

In your Hugo site `themes` directory, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vimux/mainroad
```

Next, open `config.toml` in the base of the Hugo site and ensure the theme option is set to `mainroad`:

```
theme = "mainroad"
```
